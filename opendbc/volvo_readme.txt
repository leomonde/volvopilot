The zero of SteeringAngleServo is very importanto for directional systems.
Put the steer perfectly straight and read the Real Steer on display.
Than subtract the Real Steer value from zero value on SteeringAngleServo on DBC.
EXAMPLE: With straight steer you reed "-4.00" degrees. So you change the "-1468" to "-1464"
